Discord Youtube Bot

A bot that joins your discord server and plays your favorite songs and videos from YouTube.

When cloning, run "npm install .", then make a .env file and set DISCORD_TOKEN to the token of your discord bot, CLIENT_ID to the application id of your bot, and the GUILD_ID (optional) to your server ID. Invite the bot, run "node deploy-commands.js" and if it runs without errors, run "node index.js" to start the bot.

Linting rules can be modified in .eslintrc.json and commands are stored in the commands folder.
